		{
			question: 'How do I replace the battery?',
			answer: 'Your scale arrives with 2 CR2032 batteries—one for now, and one for later. When you see a "Lo" error message on the screen, that means that your battery is low and it\'s time for the next one. To replace it, just turn your scale over, slide the battery cover open, pop the old battery out, and place in the new CR2032 battery with the positive end facing you. Then, close the battery cover and your scale should work as normal.'
		},
		{
			question: 'I keep pressing the ZERO or UNIT button but nothing happens. What’s wrong?',
			answer: 'Because the buttons are part of the surface of the scale, you need to make sure you are pressing squarely in the center of the button with the pad of your finger. If this still doesn’t work, please contact Customer Support for additional help'
		},
		{
			question: 'How do I change the unit of measure?',
			answer: 'Tap the UNIT button to switch between grams, ounces, fluid ounces, and milliliters.'
